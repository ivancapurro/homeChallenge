## Backend Improvements

In the backend of our project, several enhancements have been identified to improve the overall functionality and maintainability. Here are the key updates:

- **Error Logging**: Logging for error handling in the catch statements has been added. This allows for quick identification and resolution of issues using tools like Elasticsearch.

- **Error Handling Layer**: A error handling layer has been implemented, following well-structured guidelines that align with our business scenarios. This ensures a more reliable and resilient application.

- **Authentication Library**: To enhance security measures, it is advisable to integrate an authentication library like OAuth. This will enable secure access control and protect sensitive data.

- **Unit Testing**: A dedicated test project has been added for thorough unit testing. This ensures code quality and reliability, allowing us to identify and address potential issues prior to deployment.

- **End-to-End Experience**: Consider incorporating Cypress for UI testing, which can provide a  end-to-end experience. Additionally, implementing a seed procedure to match data can create a realistic testing environment, further enhancing the testing process.
- **Architecture Improvement**: Additional layers have been introduced to the project, adhering to best practices and clean architecture guidelines. This facilitates abstraction and separation of concerns, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

## Frontend Enhancements

Significant updates have been made to the frontend of our project to enhance usability and organization. Here are the key improvements:

- **Service Folder**: A dedicated service folder has been added, improving code organization and allowing for easy locating and management of all services within the project.

- **Bootstrap Styling**: Bootstrap has been incorporated to enhance the visual experience of our application, providing a consistent and polished look and feel.

- **Endpoint URL Adjustments**: Necessary adjustments to the endpoint URLs have been made to align with recent backend changes. This ensures smooth communication between the frontend and backend components.

- **CORS Configuration**: Consider configuring CORS to avoid potential issues when interacting with the backend. This ensures seamless integration and data exchange.

- **State Management**: NgRx has been suggested as a state management library to enhance the application's state management capabilities. This enables efficient management and synchronization of state across components.

- **Testing**: Some tests have been added to the frontend. However, given the short time window, there is room for improvement in terms of test coverage. Conducting a thorough code review and identifying areas with insufficient test coverage can guide future testing efforts.

## Next Steps

While we have made significant progress, there are still numerous opportunities for further improvement and functionality. Your careful review of the documentation and valuable insights and suggestions are highly appreciated.
